Java developer at DWP/BPDTS. Ex FullStack Developer at Barclays working with technologies such as Java, React.js, Jest, Maven/Gradle, JavaScript MVC, JQuery and SASS. I have had previous commercial experience with C#, ASP.net, PL-SQL, Oracle Database, Oracle Apex Builder, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have also been working with database systems such as MySQL and T-SQL and have also been working with tools such as Jenkins, Bladelogic and AWS. I am always active and hungry for knowledge. I am a quick learner and I try to teach myself looking at examples available. I have experience with online tools to create websites such as inWeby, Interspire, Google Sites , BigCartel, Big Commerce and WordPress. I even have my own linux based server on which I am hosting a WordPress website for my client, www.ledhubuk.com. I have experience with SSL Security. In my free time I tend to improve my skills as a developer by going through online tutorials, kata solutions and play around with code/websites on my server.
